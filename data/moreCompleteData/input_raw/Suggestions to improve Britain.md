# Suggestions to improve Britain

## Reviving High Streets and Town Centres

### Implement free or cheaper parking in town centres
- **@RupertLowe10** (2025-11-01): All councils should be implementing free car parking in select areas to boost footfall. Our high streets are dying... That starts with parking. [Link](https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/1855592738472734720)
- **** (): It starts with car parking, make it free same as out of town..."  (see replies) [Link](https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/1855592738472734720)

### Pedestrianise streets or remove distinctions between pavement and road
- **@Bowmore_SOU** (2025-12-01): One solution would be to pedestrianise the whole street, removing any distinction between pavement and road... Pedestrians would then be free to walk anywhere with no kerbs to negotiate. [Link](https://x.com/Bowmore_SOU/status/1867549823472935184)
- **@heritage_surv** (2025-12-01): Fuck the cars off, install benches, seats, tables, cafes... do what they do in Europe and make it a safe place to be social with no traffic. [Link](https://x.com/heritage_surv/status/1869034710293471742)
