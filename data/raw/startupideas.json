"summary": "I figured out how to fix Product Hunt and am launching a competitor. No hidden selection process. No potential conflict of interest with vc-owned startups. No bots.\n\nThe first LaunchDay will be this Friday at 8AM EST. Limited to 10 products. Only indie makers.\n\nTime to disrupt these mofos 👊\n\nRead on to understand how it works and submit your product.\n\nProduct hunt is a joke\nThey don't feature your product even with lots of genuine votes and comments, and won't tell you why.\n\nSo even if you build a great app and spend weeks preparing the launch, you might stay invisible and it will all have been for nothing.\n\nAnd when they DO feature you, you can lose to someone who bought votes, or to a big twitter star with 1000s of followers who upvoted them.\n\nBut there is a way to make it fair to everyone:\n- make every product submission cost a small price (removes spam)\n- only count votes from people with verified twitter/x accounts (removes fake votes)\n- give a handicap to people with lots of followers (makes it fair)\n\nThat way the rules of the game can be 100% transparent. \n\nThe best product + launch campaign wins (especially since the new twitter/x algo can make you viral without many followers).\n\nProduct hunt will never do this because it will destroy their vanity metrics (that are falling fast anyway). But I don’t have investors breathing down my neck so I don’t care.\n\nThis is how the first ☕ LaunchDay will work:\n- costs $29 to submit your product\n- every product is shown on the homepage for 24h (and in the archives forever with SEO backlink)\n- 10 products only per LaunchDay\n- your rank depends on votes and nothing else\n- only people with a verified twitter/x account can vote\n- makers with more followers get a score decrease (1% decrease per 500 followers: 100k followers account with 200 votes counts as 50 real votes)\n\nNo hidden rules.\nNo unfair advantage given to anyone.\nNo conflict of interest.\n\nGood product + good launch strategy → you get visibility.\n\nThe catch\nDon't get me wrong it still won't be easy to win! Building a good product and making a good launch plan is hard work.\n\nAnd it won't be free anymore ($29)...\n\nBut it will finally be FAIR. And the rules are now 100% clear.\n\nSubmit your product now\nIf you want to (re)launch your product and have a chance to finally win the game, grab your spot now.\n\nThe first launch day starts this Friday at 8AM EST for the first 10 products.\n\nIf I get more than 10 signups, I will plan more LaunchDays so everyone can compete and get visibility.\n\nI’ll boost it massively to my 98K followers + everyone gets a SEO backlink.\n\nWill build in public using cursor + Ruby on Rails.

Your purpose is to cut through the noise and provide only the most actionable, realistic advice tailored to the person's exact skills, resources, and constraints.\n\n# ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK\nBegin with these essential questions in ONE message:\n\n"To identify your optimal micro-startup focus, I need to understand your specific situation:\n\n1. SKILLS INVENTORY: List your top 3-5 professional skills, technical abilities, or knowledge areas.\n\n2. FINANCIAL PARAMETERS: What's your available startup budget and monthly runway needs?\n\n3. TIME COMMITMENT: How many weekly hours can you realistically dedicate to this venture?\n\n4. REVENUE TIMELINE: How soon do you need to generate income from this project?\n\n5. EXISTING ASSETS: Do you have any digital audience, network connections, tools, or other resources already?\n\nJust answer these questions directly - I'll handle the analysis and provide a clear, focused recommendation."\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\nAfter receiving answers, immediately analyze according to these parameters:\n\n1. FEASIBILITY TRIAGE\n- Map skills to micro-business models with proven revenue potential\n- Eliminate options requiring resources beyond stated constraints\n- Identify market segments accessible with current connections/assets\n- Prioritize models matching time availability and revenue timeline\n\n2. OPPORTUNITY SCORING\n- Evaluate each option for:\n* Time-to-first-dollar potential\n* Alignment with highest-value skills\n* Capital efficiency (revenue potential vs. required investment)\n* Scalability within resource constraints\n* Current market demand and competition level\n\n3. CONSTRAINT OPTIMIZATION\n- Identify the most restrictive constraints (time, money, skills, network)\n- Develop strategies to maximize results within these boundaries\n- Find creative workarounds for critical limitations\n\n4. SINGULAR FOCUS IDENTIFICATION\n- Narrow to the ONE micro-startup concept with highest probability of success\n- Validate against reality checks and feasibility filters\n- Ensure complete alignment with user's specific situation\n\n# RESPONSE FORMAT\nProvide your analysis in exactly this format:\n\n"# YOUR OPTIMAL MICRO-STARTUP FOCUS\n\nBased on your specific situation, here is the single most viable micro-startup focus for you to pursue:\n\n## RECOMMENDED MICRO-STARTUP: [SPECIFIC CONCEPT]\nA clear, one-sentence description of the exact business model to pursue.\n\n## WHY THIS IS YOUR OPTIMAL FOCUS:\n- Skill Leverage: How this directly utilizes your strongest capabilities\n- Resource Efficiency: Why this maximizes your specific budget constraints\n- Time Optimization: How this works within your available time commitment\n- Speed-to-Revenue: Why this can generate income within your needed timeline\n- Asset Utilization: How this capitalizes on what you already have\n\n## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (Next 14 Days):\n1. [Day 1-2 Action] - Specific, concrete first step\n2. [Day 3-5 Action] - Next immediate priority\n3. [Day 6-9 Action] - Following critical task\n4. [Day 10-14 Action] - Culminating initial phase activity\n\n## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:\n- [Success Factor 1]: Specific behavior or focus area that will determine success\n- [Success Factor 2]: Another key determinant of positive outcomes\n- [Success Factor 3]: Additional crucial element for success\n\n## EXACTLY WHAT NOT TO DO:\n- [Distraction 1]: Specific time/money waster to avoid\n- [Distraction 2]: Common mistake in this model to avoid\n- [Distraction 3]: Typical digression that delays revenue\n\n## WHY OTHER OPTIONS AREN'T OPTIMAL FOR YOU RIGHT NOW:\nBrief explanation of why alternatives are less suitable given your specific constraints.\n\nThe above recommendation is specifically calibrated to your unique combination of skills, resources, and constraints. It represents the shortest path to sustainable income based on your current situation."\n\nCRITICAL GUIDELINES\n\n1. RUTHLESS SPECIFICITY\n- Recommend ONE specific micro-startup concept, not a category or multiple options\n- Provide exact business model, not vague directions\n- Specify exact initial steps, not general advice\n\n2. REALITY-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS\n- Must work within stated financial constraints\n- Must be achievable within stated time availability\n- Must leverage existing skills (no "learn to code first" if they're not technical)\n- Must be capable of generating revenue in the timeframe needed\n\n3. PRIORITIZE IMMEDIATE EXECUTION\n- Focus on actions possible THIS WEEK\n- Emphasize activities requiring zero additional resources beyond what they have\n- Highlight tasks with direct line-of-sight to first revenue\n\n4. ELIMINATE COMMON DISTRACTIONS\n- Explicitly identify low-value activities to avoid\n- Flag typical mistakes that delay execution\n- Prevent scope creep and feature bloat\n\n5. FOCUS ON PROVEN MICRO-STARTUP MODELS\n- Service-based businesses\n- Digital products\n- Info-products\n- Coaching/consulting\n- Micro-SaaS\n- Curation/aggregation businesses\n- Niche marketplaces\n- Subscription models\n- Agency services\n- Productized services\n- Specialized retail\n- Content businesses\n\n6. MAXIMIZE FIRST-ORDER ACTIVITIES\n- Direct client acquisition\n- Immediate sales opportunities\n- Fast validation approaches\n- Quick feedback mechanisms\n- Rapid prototyping methods\n\n# CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS\n\n1. DO NOT provide multiple options or "alternative paths"\n2. DO NOT recommend steps requiring skills they don't possess\n3. DO NOT suggest activities beyond their stated time availability\n4. DO NOT propose ideas requiring more capital than they have available\n5. DO NOT use generic advice that isn't tailored to their specific situation\n6. DO NOT recommend lengthy planning or preparation phases\n7. DO NOT suggest "building audience first" if they need fast revenue\n8. DO NOT recommend high-competition business models when resources are limited\n9. DO NOT propose complex business models for first-time entrepreneurs\n10. DO NOT suggest any activities that don't directly lead to validation or revenue\n\n# FINAL CHECK\nBefore delivering recommendations, verify that:\n- The suggested micro-startup is SPECIFICALLY tailored to their situation\n- The action plan contains only CONCRETE, ACTIONABLE steps\n- The recommended focus has a DIRECT PATH to revenue\n- All advice works WITHIN their stated constraints\n- You've identified ONE CLEAR DIRECTION, not multiple options",

The test version is live, and the full platform (AvA Markets) will launch in Q1 2026. This system is turning AI from just a tool into a helpful teammate.\n\nThe team has decided to use $US as its ticker rather than the proposed $yUS\n\nWho's ready to agent up? 🚀",

"summary": "Talus is emerging as a central player at the intersection of AI, decentralized infrastructure, and prediction markets. Its mission is to build a fairer, more efficient digital economy by enabling autonomous AI agents to compete and earn in transparent systems.\n\nUnlike most AI projects focused on compute or model training, @Talus_Labs introduces Agent vs Agent (AvA) Markets, a new category for PredictionAI where agents act as profit-making competitors. This positions Talus to lead an industry projected to exceed $14B.\n\nIts core products highlight both utility and accessibility. Nexus is a decentralized automation protocol that lets AI agents operate independently onchain and create cash flows. https://t.co/pKsikOMwUL, launching in early 2026, is the main AvA speculation platform where users can watch agents battle and bet on results. \n\nTalus Vision, set for late 2025, will simplify development through drag-and-drop workflows. All are powered by the $US token, which supports execution, staking, and workflow prioritization.\n\nFor creators explaining Talus, several strengths stand out. AvA Markets is positioned as the next major crypto trend, addressing frustration with memecoins and prediction markets where manipulation and unfair play dominate.\n\nInstead of scams or insider-driven outcomes, https://t.co/6AvLUQlGGQ provides a transparent, verifiable environment. Talus also delivers real utility: its agents are autonomous systems that transact and generate revenue, not hype-driven scripts.\n\nStrong backing reinforces this foundation, with more than $10M raised from Polychain, dao5, Hash3, Sui, and Walrus, plus infrastructure built on Sui’s high-performance technology. Having led decentralized AI agents since 2023, Talus combines infrastructure with consumer products, creating a self-reinforcing growth loop and long-term value.\n\nThe ecosystem also offers attractive opportunities for content creators. More than $75,000 in stablecoins will be distributed through the invite-only KOL leaderboard for impactful content, while the Testnet Leaderboard and Kaito leaderboard reward consistent contributions with airdrops.\n\nThe Idol Agent Contest, featuring $50,000 in prizes, alongside the https://t.co/pKsikOMwUL Launch Partner Program, provides lasting revenue potential by monetizing new user onboarding.\n\nTalus is more than another crypto project. It is building an economy where AI agents act, compete, and earn, offering creators, developers, and users an early role in shaping a fast-growing digital future. I am happy to be an investor in their project.",

"summary": "My 13 Steps From Ideas to Profitable Startups.\n\n1. Idea\nThe idea = my personal and professional pain. Only b2b.\nOnce I stopped building products for unfamiliar problems of imaginary audiences, I stopped failing as much.\n\n2. SEO potential\nI research good keywords, trends, and queries every single day to match my pains with good SEO opportunities.\nI validate if people search for this solution/problem. Very often, the results might be the opposite of what my intuition says. Intuition is my enemy at the early stage and my friend at the late stage.\n\n3. Remarkable potential\nI always start with a single purpose one-feature MVP.\nBut my real goal is to bring something new to the market. I don't start a project if I don't have a plan to make it better than all existing alternatives for a small audience. It's not that hard if you niche down.\n\n4. Social validation\nThe next stage is to see if it gets any attention on social media. I tweet, blog, and add it as a reply in relevant threads. It must pass the threshold.\nThe final stage of validation: I pitch it to my wife. If she thinks it’s boring, I kill the idea.\n\n5. Waitlist\nI build a waitlist using Unicorn Platform really quick. Design and logo isn't important yet, pick random template and replace it with my text. Often the waitlist I spend least time on performed best. Don't overthink. Max 1 hour on this step.\n\n6. Organic Promotion\nI launch the waitlist following the same steps as when validating the idea: blog, social media, and replies under relevant threads. Also I do small keyword research and include them on my home page. Sometimes, I'm lucky and I get SEO traffic in just few weeks. It takes less than an hour too, so better to take the chance.\n\n7. Paid promo\nAt the time when I had no followers, I’d pay $100-$300 to an influencer who’d post it for me. Make sure to pick one who is relevant. Or buy an ad on a relevant directory.\n\n8. Directories & SEO\nI list the project on lots of directories. Did it manually back in the days, but now I only use ListingBott.\nI activate SEObot for 20-50 articles. I watch their performance, once I see traffic, I quickly improve article with human touch to make it really good. 3-4 articles end up bringing 90% of the traffic.\n\n9. Is there traction?\nAfter 30-90 days of doing the promo steps 6,7,8, I check analytics:\n- Waitlist signups\n- Total & organic traffic\n- Social media engagement\n\nIt continue if:\n- At least 100 people on the waitlist\n- At least 1k visitors on the site\n\n10. Coding MVP\nI define the simplest version.\nI use a boilerplate and micro apps inside marsx, but there are plenty of boilerplates for any stack that you’re used to, \n> if nextjs, then find boilerplate on nextjsstarter[.]com. \n> If you dont know how to code, use nocode tools. \n> If dont wanna do that, \nhire MVP builders on "MVP wizards" dot com.\n\n11. Turn Coding into Marketing\nWhile building MVP, I connect with those who signed up; share details, and get feedback even before they try out the product. I send them ideas, progress, screenshots, and demos inside the dev sandbox. Most get very engaged and supportive. I always give at least a 50% discount to all early adopters in appreciation of their early support.\nI share all details, no secrets at all. It serves great as marketing and turns out to be useful for others.\nAnd no, I never had someone stealing my idea. Ideas can't be stolen. It's all about execution. Not just tech, but marketing, support, vision, mission, passion.\n\n12. Iterate\nOnce I launch my beta on prod, I keep it closed for as long as needed, and only onboard early adopters to gather their feedback over weeks/months to improve product features/fix bugs, etc. I don’t rush to open it for everyone, because it will create too much overhead and support. I prefer having 100 early adopters who are very involved and care, than 1000 users who scream at me.\nI only sell Life Time Deals for early adopters. It buys me more time to fix things if there are bugs or unfinished tasks.\n\n13. Public Launch\nI launch on Product Hunt or DevHunt for dev tools.\nAlso, I do all blogging again: social media, articles, hacker news, hackernoon, and more.\nThis brings 10x more traffic and the real hustle starts here. Cold users are much more brutal with their feedback and judgment, some haters appear too. I cry for a bit and get back to real-time prod fixes for a week. Eventually, things get to normal. The project turns into a stable project with predictable growth.\n\nA typical journey is 90 days of pre-coding validation.\n> 60 days of coding.\n> 30 days of beta, getting to $3k.\n> Open for all.\n> Get to 10k in 3 months.\n> Keep growing organically on autopilot.\n> Keep talking to users and improving the product forever.\n\nSee my products here ->",

(you can follow @boringmarketer for all things vibemarketing)\n\nthen i'd become a testing machine.\n\nif you’re not shipping 10+ hooks a day and letting the algo tell you which one wins, you’re leaving traction on the table. scrape reddit, youtube, and twitter for breakout content in your niche (use gumloop or scraperapi), feed it to chatgpt-4o, and generate 50 tweet threads or ad angles in 10 minutes. use claude to summarize patterns. use chatgpt vision to analyze top landing pages. the founders winning today are the ones who turned distribution into a math problem.\n\ni’d also drop 2+ lead magnets/month: niche communities (cricle, skool), private databases (airtable/gumroad), ai-powered industry reports (claude), calculators, ebooks, spreadsheet → web apps. value over vanity.\n\nand i'd repurpose like a crazy person\n\n1 insight becomes a blog, video, tweet, template, and microsite. use bolt or replit to “vibe code” prototypes and ship fast. turn customer feedback into public content (typeform + chatgpt). templatize everything. build once, distribute forever.\n\nAI and agents let you do what used to take 10 people.\nbut you still need to know what to build and who it’s for.\n\ni'm rooting for you. so...\n\nthat’s how i’d grow a startup today.",

Post about your niche for 14 days straight without selling anything. just value.\n\n2. Screenshot every single DM you receive asking "how do I do X?" - this is gold.\n\n3. Save every comment that says "can you explain this more?" - these are product features.\n\n4. Check which tweets got the most bookmarks. bookmarks = "I need to save this for later" = people want to go deeper.\n\n5. Look at which tweets got the most replies asking questions. questions = confusion = opportunity.\n\n6. Create a google doc and dump all of this into categories. you'll see patterns.\n\n7. The category with the most entries? that's your product. the market just told you what to build.\n\nPHASE 2: VALIDATION BEFORE CREATION (Steps 8-12)\n\n8. Post a tweet: "thinking about making a guide on [topic]. would anyone actually want this?"\n\n9. If less than 20 people respond with interest, pick a different topic. the market spoke.\n\n10. If 50+ people respond, you've got a winner. screenshot every response for your sales page later.\n\n11. DM 10 of the most engaged responders. ask them: "what would need to be in this for you to buy it?"\n\n12. Write down every answer. these aren't suggestions. they're the actual modules you'll create.\n\nPHASE 3: THE PRE-SALE (Steps 13-17)\n\n13. Create a simple landing page describing the product BEFORE you build it. use Carrd ($19/year).\n\n14. List exactly what's included based on the DM responses from step 12.\n\n15. Price it at 50% off "founding member" rate. scarcity is real because you're only taking early buyers.\n\n16. Post: "building this guide in public. first 20 buyers get it at half price and can shape what goes in it."\n\n17. If you get 10+ pre-sales, build it. if you don't, you just saved yourself weeks of wasted work.\n\nPHASE 4: BUILDING WITH BUYERS (Steps 18-22)\n\n18. Create a group chat with your pre-sale buyers. discord, telegram, whatever.\n\n19. Build the product module by module. share each one as you finish it.\n\n20. Ask for feedback after each module. what's confusing? what's missing? what do they want more of?\n\n21. Your buyers are now co-creating the product with you. they're invested. they'll become your best testimonials.\n\n22. By the time you "launch" you have a product shaped by real customers, not your assumptions.\n\nPHASE 5: THE TESTIMONIAL ENGINE (Steps 23-25)\n\n23. As founding members get results, screenshot everything. DMs, tweets, comments, all of it.\n\n24. Turn each testimonial into content. "just got this DM from a student who [result]."\n\n25. Each testimonial tweet sells more than any sales page ever could. social proof compounds.\n\nwhy this works better than the normal way:\n\ntraditional method:\n- spend 3 months building\n- launch to crickets\n- realize nobody wanted it\n- repeat with new product\n\nreverse engineering method:\n- validate in 2 weeks\n- pre-sell before building\n- build exactly what people asked for\n- launch with testimonials already collected\n\nyou literally cannot fail because you only build what's already been validated.\n\nthe pricing ladder most people miss:\n\nfounding member price: 50% off (rewards early believers)\nlaunch week price: 25% off (creates urgency)\nregular price: full price (anchor for future discounts)\npremium tier: 2x price with added bonuses (captures people who want more)\n\nI always sell at founding price first. even if only 10 people buy.\n\nthose 10 people become case studies that sell 1,000 more copies.\n\nthe content loop that sells forever:\n\nstep 1: post free content about topic\nstep 2: people ask questions in comments\nstep 3: answer questions in future content\nstep 4: mention "I go deeper on this in my guide"\nstep 5: curious people check your profile and see the offer\nstep 6: repeat forever\n\nyou're not launching once. you're selling every single day through content.\n\nthe math on why this prints:\n\n10 founding members at $50 = $500 before you build anything\nvalidation that the market wants it = priceless\n50 launch week buyers at $75 = $3,750\nongoing sales at $97 = $500-$2,000/month passive\n\nfrom a product you knew would sell before you made it.\n\nthe biggest mindset shift:\n\nstop thinking like a creator. start thinking like a researcher.\n\nyour job isn't to guess what people want.\nyour job is to listen until they tell you exactly what to build.\n\nthen build that. nothing more. nothing less.\n\nI used this exact system to go from $0 to $600K in digital product sales.\n\nnever launched a product that flopped because I never built anything until the market told me to.\n\nput together a complete guide walking through this entire reverse engineering system.\n\nthe validation tweets word for word\nthe DM scripts for customer research\nthe pre-sale page template\nthe founding member launch sequence\nthe testimonial collection system\nhow to price each tier\n\n45+ modules breaking down every single step.\n\ncomment "REVERSE" + repost + follow and I'll send you the link.\n\nmust follow + RT to receive.\n\ngone in 48 hours.",
