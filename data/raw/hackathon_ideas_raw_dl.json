People who sign up on the platform can take courses on climate change. After learning, they will get virtual points. The virtual points redeemed after taking the courses can be exchanged for scholarships, some paid courses, and cash support for tree planting programs. The uniqueness of this program lies in its strong technical support, with the founder developing a barcode system for tree recognition. When people scan the barcode, it will display all the detailed information about the trees. Currently, this program has started in a local community by helping in the biodiversity conservation of the community, and a total of 500 trees were donated there.",

They were chosen for a reason. These two were my personal favs - - Turn any camera into a smart monitor that you can set alerts in natural language. - Billboards that create and swap ads in real time based on local news + twitter feeds And don't forget to take the mandatory photo with YC logo with your teammates @adi_suresh01 @AkritiKeswani @Laylaliuuu",
